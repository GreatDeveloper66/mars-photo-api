to connect the backend you will need to have a mongoose database set up on your local machine 
or in the cloud. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com to set up a mongo database in the cloud. Free 
tiers are available. In addition, to connect the backend to the database with the api you must create a .env file and add a API key URI that connects to the mongo database. See .env.sample.
